Project Description
By: David Carlyn & Paul “PJ” Leyden

Tower Defender

Description:
	The game is a 2D tower defense game in which a terrain is generated and the player is given a castle and road to place down. After placing the castle and road going to it from the edge of the map, they will be given funds to place towers. They may then place towers and initiate the first round. This will continue until the player loses or quits.
	The game will have enemies and two different towers. The enemy's goal is to simply get to the castle, while the player’s goal is to set up the path and tower in such a way that no enemy will reach the castle.
