Project Title: 	Tower Defender (WIP)

Description: 
	The aim of the game will be to create a 2D (possibly orthographic) tower defense game 
in which a teraain is generated and the player is given a castle and road to place down. After 
placing the castle and road going to it from the edge of the map they will be given funds to 
place towers. They may then place towers and initiate the first round. This will continue 
until the player loses or quits.

	The game will have an asortment of enemies and towers. The enemies' goal is to simply get to the castle, 
while the player's goal is to set up the path and towers in such a way that no enemy will reach the castle.

	This description will continually be added to as the game is developed. If we complete all the goals
before the end of the semester then we will add more aspects such a story line, or create more towers and
enemies with more functionality.
